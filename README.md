# Apache Beam and Data Engineering Projects

This repository contains three distinct data engineering projects, each focusing on different aspects of data exploration, automated analysis, and data pipeline transformations. These projects utilize tools like Apache Beam, D3.js, and Sweetviz for comprehensive data engineering and analysis tasks.

---

## Project Overview

This repository is organized into three standalone projects, each demonstrating unique data engineering capabilities:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with D3.js**: Advanced, interactive EDA using D3.js for in-depth data insights.
2. **Automated EDA with Sweetviz**: Quick and appealing data profiling with Sweetviz for initial data exploration.
3. **Apache Beam Pipeline Demonstration**: A deep dive into Apache Beam’s features, showcasing transformations, windowing, triggers, and streaming for large-scale data processing.

## Key Features

- **Project 1: EDA with D3.js**  
  In-depth data exploration and custom visualizations with D3.js, providing high-quality insights and interactivity.

- **Project 2: Automated EDA with Sweetviz**  
  Automated EDA using Sweetviz for fast and visually appealing statistical summaries and insights.

- **Project 3: Apache Beam Pipelines**  
  Comprehensive Apache Beam demonstration covering data transformation, streaming, and advanced data engineering workflows.
