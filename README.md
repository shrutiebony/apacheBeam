3) Tailored for rich exploratory analysis
#### Project 2: Automated EDA with Sweetviz
1) Quick, automated statistical summaries and visualizations
2) Generates detailed HTML reports for faster decision-making
3) Ideal for rapid dataset profiling
#### Project 3: Apache Beam Pipeline Demonstration
1) Hands-on Apache Beam examples covering:
2) Data transformations
3) Windowing & triggers
4) Streaming workflows
5) Demonstrates scalable, production-ready data engineering concepts
